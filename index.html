In this task, you will be asked to choose between two amounts of money - one that you receive immediately and one that you receive in the future. At the end of the experiment we will select a trial at random for which the amount you picked will be rewarded to you. Since you donâ€™t know which trial it will be, you should treat every trial as if it were the only one <br> <br>

At the end of the 30 questions, you will be provided with a code that you should copy and paste into your MTurk survey.
